The piece expresses a turbulent anxiety, with a widely varying level of intensity.

The Numula rendition should use lots of nuance,
perhaps erring on the side of over-interpretation,
to sound as non-mechanical as possible.
The nuance should change; e.g. m1 and m2 should be noticeably different.

Idea: work on 1 layer at a time; disable other layers.
