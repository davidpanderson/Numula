pitch.py
    PitchOffs
        a set of pitch offsets 0..11 and optional weights
        can represent
            a scale
            a chord
        does order matter?

    Is a 9th chord same as 2nd?

    PitchSet
        a PitchOffs, plus a root pitch
        represents the set of all octave offsets
        of the root pitch plus a pitch offset
        The probabilities carry over
        
        rnd_uniform(lo, hi)
            random pitch in lo..hi
                (need not be in the pitch set)
        rnd_normal(mean, stddev, maxsigma)
            mean need not be in pitch set
        next_above(p)
        next_below(p)
        contains(p)
            does PS contain P?

time_list.py
    lists of times

    time_list_periodic(n,dur)
        n regularly-spaced times
    time_list_random(n, dur)
        random times in 0..dur
    time_list_random_set(n, lo, hi)
        n times separated by random(lo..hi)
    time_list_scale(list, dur)
        scale list to 0..dur
    time_list_snap(list, dt)
        snap to multiples of dt

curtain.py
    curtain
        density (notes/sec)
        pitch set
        center
        width
        (the above are PFTs)
        pitch: gaussian or uniform
        whether to allow repeated notes

colorednoise.py
    1/f noise and brownian noise

ideas
scales
    major:          2 2 1 2 2 2 1
    natural minor:  2 1 2 2 1 2 2
    harmonic minor: 2 1 2 2 1 3 1
    melodic minor:  2 1 2 2 2 2 1
        (ascending)
harmonic system
    Given two pitchsets, we can compute their distance
        (the number of pitches in common).
    so given a pitchoffs, we can look at the 11 pitchsets
        and make a graph
        We can move between pitchsets in a 1/f way:
        occasional jumps, drifting back to center
    chord, abstract
        a subset of a pitchoffs
        one is designated as root
    chord, concrete
    chord voicing
        inversion
        spacing
    chord sequence (abstract, concrete)
        chord + scale over time
    voice leading

    motion:
        circle of fifths
        thirds
        stepwise

binary time lists
    recursive binary subdivision
    leave as is, or divide into 2
        or 3?
    sometimes tie to next note

repetition of patterns
    in rhythm seq
    in pitch contour
    in the combination of the above
    in harmony

melodies
    shape: peaks
    what are parameters?

duets
    with same or different rhythm

interlocking melodies
    think of filling in 2-D time/freq space

snippets (like bird songs)
    trill
    scale: up, down, up/down, down/up
    repeated note

streamers
    a high melody; a stream of notes leads up (cresc) to each melody note
    or the opposite

waves
    clouds of low notes surge up and break,
    producing a short cloud of high notes
    (like foam retreating)

curtains
    a 'curtain' of notes
    timing
        density (notes/sec): PFT
        note duration: PFT
        whether regularly spaced or random (Poisson)
    pitch
        distribution
            center
            width
            whether gaussian or uniform
            pitch selection
                random
                    allow repeated notes?
                cyclic
        changing pitch sets:
        chords, scales, (incl. chromatic scale)
        The transitions can be gradual or abrupt.
        the transitions can be based on note volume,
            or note frequency.
            how to describe?
        args
            list of (pitchset, start, PFT)
        alg
            foreach note
                get values of active PFTs
                if vol based
                    cycle through PFTs
                    choose note from that pitchset
                    vol is PFT value
                else
                    choose PFT randomly based on PFT values
                    use note from that pitchset
                    vol is fixed
    examples
    chord seq could be algorithmic,
    or taken from a Bach piece

jitter
    a series of notes, randomly pitch N and N+1.
    Occasionally, with a rhythm, jumping to a melody
